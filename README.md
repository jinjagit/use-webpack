# webpack
practice with webpack and related tools

Working through [this tutorial](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70), by Peter Jang (2017):

"...
The goal of this article is to provide a historical context of how JavaScript tools have evolved to what they are today in 2017. We’ll start from the beginning and build an example website like the dinosaurs did — no tools, just plain HTML and JavaScript. Then we’ll introduce different tools incrementally to see the problems that they solve one at a time. ..."

  * To run webpack manually after changing index.js, run <code>./node_modules/.bin/webpack</code>
  * Running <code>npm run server</code> on this repo will start an auto-updating dev server (localhost:8080)
  * Note: Debugging errors when using webpack bundling may be difficult without using [sourcemaps](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#using-source-maps) (not included in this example repo)
